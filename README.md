# CodeTriangle's SSH Cheatsheet

See https://codetriangle.me/projects/2024-10-06-ssh-cheatsheet/
for rationale and context.

## About

The "source" of this project
is located in ssh-cheatsheet.svg.
The document is "cloned" on the right
for the benefit of the printing setup.

The "build" step
relies on having Inkscape installed.
Run `export.sh`
and it will create:

* `out/ssh-cheatsheet.png`:
  A PNG copy of the cheatsheet,
  for posting online,
  for example,
  embedded in webpages
* `out/ssh-cheatsheet-two.pdf`:
* A printable version of the cheatsheet
  with two copies side-by-side
  on a piece of letter paper.

If you would prefer an A4 format,
you can make one yourself
or contact me
and I'll try to tweak the build system
to produce both.
